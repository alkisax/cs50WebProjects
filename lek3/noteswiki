Sure, here's a list of the issues you faced and asked for help with:

NoReverseMatch Error: You encountered a NoReverseMatch error when trying to use the URL template tag {% url 'index' %} in your layout file. The issue was due to missing app_name in urls.py.

URL and View Function Names: You had trouble understanding how to correctly reference URL patterns and view functions in Django, especially when using the {% url %} template tag.

Search Functionality: You struggled with implementing a search function that correctly redirects to the entry page when an exact match is found.

Using Search Query in URLs: You wanted to understand how to pass the search query through the URL when pressing Enter in a form without a submit button.

Passing Data from Form to View: You needed guidance on how to process and utilize input data from a form submission in Django views.

Redirecting on Search: You faced issues with ensuring that the search query leads to the correct entry page or provides feedback if no exact match is found.
